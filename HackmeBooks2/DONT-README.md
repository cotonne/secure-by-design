This file contains known weaknesses into the system. Each weakness has
a reference to [OWASP Top 10]() or [SANS 25]().
Also, a preferred way for fixing it is proposed with a set of security 
design principle that should have been applied during the development 
process.
A discussion is present to indicate technics to prevent such bugs from
being introduced.
